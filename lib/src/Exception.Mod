(**The statement

   @example
   TRY
     S
   CATCH T1(t1):
     C1
   CATCH T2(t2):
     C2
   END;
   @end example

   is roughly equivalent to

   @enumerate
   @item
   Push exception handler for this @code{TRY} block (@oproc{PushContext}).

   @item
   Evaluate @var{S}, followed by @oproc{PopContext}.  If there are any
   @code{RETURN} or @code{EXIT} statements within @var{S} that would cause
   control flow to leave the @code{TRY} statement, then they also do an
   implicit @oproc{PopContext} as part of the non-local exit.

   @item
   If an exception is raised during @var{S}, then do

   @example
   Exception.PopContext;
   temp := Exception.Current();
   WITH temp: T1 DO
     t1 := temp;
     C1;
   | temp: T2 DO
     t2 := temp;
     C2;
   ELSE
     Exception.ActivateContext;
   END;
   Exception.Clear;
   @end example
   @end enumerate

   An exception is raised by calling the predefined procedure @code{RAISE} with
   an instance of @otype{Exception}.  This passes control to the nearest
   @code{CATCH} clause whose type is an extension of the raised exception, if
   such a clause exist.  Otherwise, the exception is written to @var{stderr}
   and the program is aborted.

   Within a @code{CATCH}, the optional name given in parenthesis refers to the
   current exception that triggered the @code{CACTH}.  Its type is the one
   from the @code{CATCH} clause.  The variable is read-only.
   
   An exception @var{E} must either be caught within a procedure, or the
   procedure must declare that it may pass an exception of type @var{E} up to
   its caller.  For example,

   @example
   PROCEDURE P() RAISES E;
   @end example

   @noindent
   declares that evaluation of @samp{P} may raise an exception of type @var{E},
   or an extension thereof.

   Within the module body no exceptions can be passed up, because there is no
   caller.  As a consequence, any exception that is not caught explicity is
   written to @var{stderr} and aborts the program.

   @emph{Note}: A @code{TRY} block is mapped to C's @samp{setjmp()} function by
   @code{oo2c}.  The amount of data stored by this function depends on the
   target architecture and may differ by a factor of ten or more.  For example,
   on a @samp{ix86} processor, only 72 bytes are stored, while on a @samp{PPC}
   this is 768 bytes.  As a consequence, the work done within a @code{TRY}
   should be large enough to amortize the costs of the @code{TRY} for all
   possible targets.  *)

(*
   Each @code{TRY} block pushes an exception handler on a stack managed as a
   global variable of module Exception.  If threading is ever supported,
   then each thread needs its own pointer to the top of this stack, as
   well as its own `current' exception pointer.
