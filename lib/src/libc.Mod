(**This module defines some C functions for the convenience of modules of the
   standard library.  The declarations may be changed, moved, or removed
   without prior notice.

   The module @omodule{C} holds type and constant definitions for often used
   entities, while this module declares functions.  The reason for this
   separation is that @samp{FOREIGN} or @samp{INTERFACE} modules must be able
   to import the definitions of @omodule{C}, without pulling in any function
   prototypes that clash with the standard headers of the C library.  *)
