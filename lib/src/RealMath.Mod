(**Note: The functions defined here used to use to ``*f'' versions of the
   math functions.  These turned out to be ISO C functions, and are not
   available on Mac OSX at the time of writing.  Therefore, they were replaced
   with some C level type cast trickery, which prevent them from being
   used in a procedure variable, but should work fine otherwise.  *)

PROCEDURE ["(float)sqrt"] sqrt*(x: REAL): REAL;
(**Returns the positive square root of x where x >= 0.  *)

PROCEDURE ["(float)exp"] exp*(x: REAL): REAL;
(**Returns the exponential of x for x < Ln(MAX(REAL).  *)

PROCEDURE ["(float)ln"] ln*(x: REAL): REAL;
(**Returns the natural logarithm of x for x > 0.  *)

PROCEDURE ["(float)sin"] sin* (x: REAL): REAL;

PROCEDURE ["(float)cos"] cos* (x: REAL): REAL;
 
PROCEDURE ["(float)tan"] tan*(x: REAL): REAL;
(**Returns the tangent of x where x cannot be an odd multiple of pi/2.  *)
 
PROCEDURE ["(float)asin"] arcsin*(x: REAL): REAL;
(**Returns the arcsine of x, in the range [-pi/2, pi/2] where -1 <= x <= 1.  *)
 
PROCEDURE ["(float)acos"] arccos*(x: REAL): REAL;
(**Returns the arccosine of x, in the range [0, pi] where -1 <= x <= 1.  *)

PROCEDURE ["(float)atan"] arctan*(x: REAL): REAL;
(**Returns the arctangent of x, in the range [-pi/2, pi/2] for all x.  *)
 
PROCEDURE ["(float)pow"] power*(base, exponent: REAL): REAL;
(**Returns the value of the number base raised to the power exponent 
     for base > 0.  *)

PROCEDURE ["(float)lrint"] round*(x: REAL): LONGINT;
(**Returns the value of x rounded to the nearest integer.  *)

PROCEDURE ["(float)sincos"] sincos* (x: REAL; VAR sin, cos: REAL);
(**More efficient sin/cos implementation if both values are needed.  *)

PROCEDURE ["(float)atan2"] arctan2* (xn, xd: REAL): REAL;
(**arctan2(xn,xd) is the quadrant-correct arc tangent atan(xn/xd).  If the 
   denominator xd is zero, then the numerator xn must not be zero.  All
   arguments are legal except xn = xd = 0.  *)

PROCEDURE ["(float)sinh"] sinh* (x: REAL): REAL;
(**sinh(x) is the hyperbolic sine of x.  The argument x must not be so large 
   that exp(|x|) overflows.  *)

PROCEDURE ["(float)cosh"] cosh* (x: REAL): REAL;
(**cosh(x) is the hyperbolic cosine of x.  The argument x must not be so large
   that exp(|x|) overflows.  *)   

PROCEDURE ["(float)tanh"] tanh* (x: REAL): REAL;
(**tanh(x) is the hyperbolic tangent of x.  All arguments are legal.  *)

PROCEDURE ["(float)asinh"] arcsinh* (x: REAL): REAL;
(**arcsinh(x) is the arc hyperbolic sine of x.  All arguments are legal.  *)

PROCEDURE ["(float)acosh"] arccosh* (x: REAL): REAL;
(**arccosh(x) is the arc hyperbolic cosine of x.  All arguments greater than 
   or equal to 1 are legal.  *)
   
PROCEDURE ["(float)tanh"] arctanh* (x: REAL): REAL;
(**arctanh(x) is the arc hyperbolic tangent of x.  |x| < 1 - sqrt(em), where 
   em is machine epsilon.  Note that |x| must not be so close to 1 that the 
   result is less accurate than half precision.  *)
