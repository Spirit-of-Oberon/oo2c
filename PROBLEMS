Known installation problems (and workarounds):

----

(configure): If configure fails to link against a particular library
-lfoo, then check config.log for the error message reported by the
compiler.  Obscure messages reporting a failure determine a type size
can also be caused by a broken -lfoo entry in LDFLAGS.

----

(MacOSX): When installing from a distribution tar ball, MacOS X users
need to add "-traditional-cpp" to the gcc options, like

  CPPFLAGS="-traditional-cpp" ./configure

----

(Mandrake 9.1, Yellow Dog Linux 3.0): 

  - to compile on YDL3.0 you need GCC 3.3.1
  - if you are just installing libgc to /usr/local (tarball default):
      copy gc's include/gc.h to a new directory: /usr/local/gc/gc.h
      add /usr/local/lib to /etc/ld.so.conf AND run (/sbin/)ldconfig
  - libgc needs the dlopen symbol, which is in libdl
  - call configure with 

    CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib -ldl" ./configure
