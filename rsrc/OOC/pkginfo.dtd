<!-- Package Meta Data:

     Packages are units of delivery.  Packages are identified by a
     name and have a current version.  Software distributed as a
     package may include libraries, exectuables, and static files.
     Its meta data lists the files that are to be installed on the
     target system.

     The primary purpose of the package support of the OOC compiler is
     to aid in the deployment of libraries, and to build executables.
     It is _not_ a general purpose installation tool.

     After installation, the package's meta data is incorporated into
     the target repository to provide information on how to deinstall
     the package cleanly.  -->

<!-- Versioning uses the numbering scheme of GNU libtool.  Quoting the
     libtool manual (version 1.4.2a):

     CURRENT
	  The most recent interface number that this library implements.

     REVISION
	  The implementation number of the CURRENT interface.

     AGE
	  The difference between the newest and oldest interfaces that this
	  library implements.  In other words, the library implements all the
	  interface numbers in the range from number `CURRENT - AGE' to
	  `CURRENT'.

<!-- A library entry describes a set of modules which are transformed
     into a library (static or shared) during package build.  The
     library includes all modules from the current package that are 
     imported directly or indirectly by the given main module.

     The version information is passed directly to libtool and
     determines the version number of the produced shared library.
     It is not processed in any other way by OOC itself.  -->

<!-- When a package is installed, files listed in the file-set 
     elements are copied into the target repository.  All paths
     are interpreted relative to the current directory and the

     to copy files from/to arbitrary locations.  -->

<!-- Repository Meta Data:

     A repository is a set of installed packages.  Its primary purpose
     is to efficiently provide all information to the compiler that is
     required to use the packages' modules and files.  Secondary
     purposes are to report on the installed packages, and to support
     deinstallation of packages.

     Repository documents are created and maintained automatically,
     after install and uninstall of packages.  -->
