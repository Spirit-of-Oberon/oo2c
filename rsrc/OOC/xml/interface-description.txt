Module Name

Import List

    Lists the names of all modules imported by the interface.  The
    names are links to the modules' HTML files.

Class List

    Lists all classes that are defined in the module.  The class name
    is a local link to class summary.  The link is relative to the
    current document, using the name of the record of the class as the

    of the class, i.e., by the first sentence of the documentation of
    the record type's declaration.

Summary Sections

    Class Summary

        For every class appearing in the class list, there is a
        summary section.  Before the summary, there are anchors for
        every type declaration (record or pointer) that belong to this
        class.  From the header of a given class summary, a link
        "Detail" leads to the class details.  The class summary begins
        with an overview of the class and its base classes, followed
        by the description of the class.

        The summary also contains a table with all field, constructor,
        and method names.  The names are links to the detailed
        information for the declared object.  The first sentence of
        the documentation of a declaration is given besides the name.

        Inherited fields and methods are listed with their defining
        module.  The names are links to the corresponding HTML file.
