     It differs from "testsuite" in two points: it has an optional
     additional attribute "select", and it can have "processor-info"
     child elements.

<!-- A "processor-info" element may provide additional information

     error positions and messages that must appear in the compiler
     output for a test case to succeed.  The "processor-element" only
     applies if its "processor-name" attribute matches that of the

<!-- For a test case of type `reject', the error list emitted by the
     compiler must contain an error indicated by the pattern "pos",
     with the error message "msg".

     The position is described by a string that specifies the textual 
     context of the error.  The error location is marked by a `%'
     character.  For example, `pos="MODULE %Test"' means that the
     error must refer to a position in the source code that is
     preceeded by the literal string "MODULE ", and followed by the
     literal string "Test".
     
     Position pattern meta characters:

     %   indicates the character position

     \Z  end of file
     ^   beginning of line
     $   end of line
     \n  newline
