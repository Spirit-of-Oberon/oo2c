@chapter Introduction

@code{oo2c} v2 is a complete rewrite of the compiler and associated
tools.  Some highlights are

@itemize @bullet
@item
Reduced internal complexity, at the expense of more computational
overhead.  This goes hand in hand with the ability to add experimental
language features to the compiler.
@item
A simplified internal SSA code representation that eliminates the need
to keep track the block structure of nested statements.  This reduces
the complexity of most code transformations.  On the other hand,
producing the target code becomes more difficult.
@item
A broader range of code transformations, including loop rewriting and
partial redundancy elimination on top of the existing ones (common
subexpression elimination, loop invariant code motion, constant
propagation, algebraic transformations, and dead code elimination).
@item
A large set of regression tests, increasing the reliability and
stability of compiler releases.
@item
More built-in support for building and installing third party
packages.
@item
Writing @code{FOREIGN} modules to interface with external libraries
has become easier.  A simple @code{#include} pulls in all the run-time
type and module meta data a module needs to provide to the run-time
system.
@end itemize

The v2 compiler implements most, but not all, of the features of its
predecessor.  Most programs should compile without changes, although
some of the more esoteric features and library modules have been
dropped.  The following sections summarize the omissions and
additions.  For the most part, the language extensions are
experimental in nature and should not be considered final.


@node Programs, Library Modules, Introduction, Top
@chapter Programs

The biggest change to the behavior of the programs @code{oo2c},
@code{oob}, @code{ooef}, and @code{oowhereis} is the introduction of
so called repositories to structure source code, intermediate, and
executable files.  A @dfn{repository} is a path to a directory
@var{r} with @file{@var{r}/src/} holding the source code,
@file{@var{r}/pkginfo.xml} any repository meta data,
@file{@var{r}/sym/} the symbol files, and so on.  When looking for a
particular module, all configured repositories are searched.  Output
files for a particular module (symbol file, C files, objects files,
and so on) are placed into the repository that holds the module's
source code.

The tool @code{oocn} is gone.  Part of its functionality have been
moved into the compiler @code{oo2c}: converting a module's public
interface and its documentation strings to HTML and listing all uses
of a particular object.  Some of the command line options of
@code{oo2c} have been replaced, and it has a whole new set of commands
dealing with packages: build, install, uninstall, etc.  Packages allow
to install a set of library modules, module documentation,
executables, and auxiliary files from the meta data of a
@file{pkginfo.xml} file.

Please refer to the man page of @code{oo2c} for the details.


@node Library Modules, Doc Comments, Programs, Top
@chapter Library Modules

With the switch from oo2c v1 to v2 a number of highly specialized and
rarely used library modules were dropped, while at the same time whole
families of modules were included that were distributed separately in
the past.

Replaced by other modules: @code{Filenames} (use @code{OS:Path}
instead), @code{Integers} (use @code{Object:BigInt}), @code{Kernel}
and @code{Types} (functionality covered by @code{RT0}), and @code{Rts}
(see @code{OS:ProcessManagement}).

Removed without replacement: @code{ComplexMath}, @code{JulianDay},
@code{LComplexMath}, @code{LocNumConv}, @code{LocNumStr},
@code{LocStrings}, @code{LocText}, @code{LocTextRider},
@code{Locales}, @code{LongInts}, @code{LowLReal}, @code{LowReal},
@code{OakFiles}, @code{OakIn}, @code{OakMath}, @code{OakMathL},
@code{OakStrings}, @code{Reals}, @code{Signal}, and @code{Strings2}.

New modules:
@table @code
@item ADT:*
A set of abstract data types, most importantly @code{ArrayList} and
@code{Dictionary}.  Also provides a framework for serializing
arbitrary graphs of objects.

@item IO:*
IO modules for files and sockets, providing an interface that is
closer to the I/O capabilities provided by @code{libc}.  Also mappers
based on the new classes, and an abstraction for the @samp{select()}
function.

@item OS:*
Various low-level modules dealing with file systems, file names, and
processes.
@end table

Preliminary modules (their interface might change significantly in the
future, although their general functionality will continue to be part
of the core distribution):
@table @code
@item URI:*
Data types representing Uniform Resource Identifiers (both
hierarchical and opaque), plus an URI parser.

@item XML:*
A call-back based XML 1.0 parser.  Also includes support for XML
namespaces and validation.
@end table


@node Doc Comments, Built-in Type STRING, Library Modules, Top
@chapter Doc Comments

Documentation describing the public interface of a module can embedded
into the source code using @dfn{doc comments}.  Such comments start
with a special delimiter @samp{(**}, like @samp{(**Some
explanation. *)}, and refer to the declaration preceding them.
Within doc comments, a subset of the GNU Texinfo command set can be
used to mark up the text.

The following sections summarise the commands implemented by the OOC
parser.  Please refer to the Texinfo manual for a more thorough
description of the their syntax and intended use.

Designators can contain arbitrary @samp{.member} parts, referring to
members of modules, procedures, or records.  For example,
@samp{@@oparam@{MyModule.MyPointer.MyProc.param@}} would refer to the
parameter @samp{param} of the type-bound procedure @samp{MyProc} from
module @samp{MyModule} that has @samp{MyPointer} as its receiver type.
Unless prefixed by a @samp{*}, names and designators must refer to
existing declarations and the class of the indicated object must match
the command name.  If the designator is prefixed with a @samp{*}, then
the designator is not checked by the compiler.  In this case, it must
begin with a fully qualified module name and use the canonical
designator for the indicated object.  This variant should only be used
to refer to an object from another module if the module is not part of
the @code{IMPORT} list.

@node Built-in Type STRING, Exceptions, Doc Comments, Top
@chapter Built-in Type STRING

The predefined identifier @code{STRING} is an alias for the type
@samp{Object.String}, which implements Unicode strings.  The semantics
of this type are defined for the most part by the regular module
@samp{Object}@footnote{The module @samp{Object} does not need to be
imported to use @code{STRING}.  It is part of the run-time system and
as such included into every program.}, with two exceptions: the
compiler converts string constants to instances of @code{STRING}
automatically, and the operator @samp{+} performs string
concatenation.

String constants are assignment compatible with variables of type
@samp{Object.Object}.  Such an assignment automatically converts the
constant into an instance of @code{STRING}.  That is, a string
constant can be used instead of a @code{STRING} in an assignment, for
a procedure argument passed to a value parameter, and as a function
result.  The string object is created once, as part of the module's
initialization code, @emph{not} each time its surrounding code is
evaluated.

The operator @samp{+} is defined for string operands and returns the
concatenation of its operands.  The result is of type @code{STRING}.

Please note that comparison of string values is done by means of the
type-bound procedure @samp{String.Equals}.  The definition of the
operators @samp{=} and @samp{#} has @emph{not} been changed.  That is,
they test for object identity by comparing the strings' pointer
values.

@node Exceptions, Parametric Types, Built-in Type STRING, Top
@chapter Exceptions

There are four user visible parts to exceptions:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The module @samp{Exception}, defining the type @samp{Exception} and
implementing the required run-time support.
@item
A new statement, @code{TRY}, to transfer control to exception handlers
if a statement sequence raises an exception.
@item
A new predefined procedure, @code{RAISE}, to raise an exception.
@item
An extended syntax for procedures and procedure types, to declare
which checked exception can be raised by a procedure.
@end itemize

Exceptions behave pretty much like their counterparts in Python or
Java.  The statement

@example
TRY
  S
CATCH T1(t1):
  C1
CATCH T2(t2):
  C2
END;
@end example

is roughly equivalent to

@enumerate
@item
Push exception handler for this @code{TRY} block
(@samp{Exception.PushContext}).

@item
Evaluate @var{S}, followed by @samp{Exception.PopContext}.  If there
are any @code{RETURN} or @code{EXIT} statements within @var{S} that
would cause control flow to leave the @code{TRY} statement, then they
also do an implicit @samp{PopContext} as part of the non-local exit.

@item
If an exception is raised during @var{S}, then do

@example
Exception.PopContext;
temp := Exception.Current();
WITH temp: T1 DO
  t1 := temp;
  C1;
| temp: T2 DO
  t2 := temp;
  C2;
ELSE
  Exception.ActivateContext;
END;
Exception.Clear;
@end example
@end enumerate

An exception is raised by calling the predefined procedure @code{RAISE} with
an instance of @samp{Exception}.  This passes control to the nearest
@code{CATCH} clause whose type is an extension of the raised exception, if
such a clause exist.  Otherwise, the exception is written to @var{stderr}
and the program is aborted.

Within a @code{CATCH}, the optional name given in parenthesis refers to the
current exception that triggered the @code{CATCH}.  Its type is the one
from the @code{CATCH} clause.  The variable is read-only.

An exception @var{E} must either be caught within a procedure, or the
procedure must declare that it may pass an exception of type @var{E} up to
its caller.  For example,

@example
PROCEDURE P() RAISES E;
@end example

@noindent
declares that evaluation of @samp{P} may raise an exception of type @var{E},
or an extension thereof.

Within the module body no exceptions can be passed up, because there is no
caller.  As a consequence, any exception that is not caught explicitly is
written to @var{stderr} and aborts the program.

@emph{Implementation note}: A @code{TRY} block is mapped to C's
@samp{setjmp()} function by @code{oo2c}.  The amount of data stored by
this function depends on the target architecture and may differ by a
factor of ten or more.  For example, on a @samp{ix86} processor, only
72 bytes are stored, while on a @samp{PPC} this is 768 bytes.  As a
consequence, the work done within a @code{TRY} should be large enough
to amortize the costs of the @code{TRY} for all possible targets.

On some systems@footnote{At the time of writing, this means all
systems running with GNU @code{libc} and implementing the
@samp{backtrace()} function.}, raising an exception also stores
information about the top 20 activation frames on the call stack.
This means that raising an exception can be moderately expensive as
well.  Therefore they should only be used to report exceptional
conditions that are rarely triggered.

@emph{Possible changes}: At the time of writing, only checked
exceptions are supported.  That is, exceptions must be explicitly
declared or caught.  It is expected that unchecked exceptions are
added in the future, where a procedure may raise any exception without
announcing it to its callers.  Which of the two modes, checked or
unchecked, becomes then the default behavior is open to discussions.


@node Parametric Types, Initialization Functions, Exceptions, Top
@chapter Parametric Types

A parametric type can be seen as a type definition with a certain
degree of freedom.  The freedom comes in form of type parameters
acting as placeholders for type arguments that are provided when the
parametric type is used in a particular context.  There are two
restrictions on type parameters and type arguments: the parameter must
be based on a record pointer, and the argument must be an extension of
the parameter's base type.

Take for example the type @samp{ArrayList}.  The element type of the
list can be any type derived from @samp{Object}, like
@samp{MyElementType}, which is provided when creating an
@samp{ArrayList} variable:

@example
TYPE
  ArrayList*(E: Object.Object) = POINTER TO ArrayListDesc(E);
  ArrayListDesc*(E: Object.Object) = RECORD
    @dots{}
  END;
@dots{}
VAR myList: ArrayList(MyElementType);
@end example

@noindent
The compiler statically detects any uses of @samp{myList} or of its
methods that are incompatible with the declared element type
@samp{MyElementType}.

The implementation of parametric types extends the syntax in three
places:

@itemize @bullet
@item
A type declaration can have a list of type parameters.
@item
Usage of a parametric type can provide a list of type arguments.
@item
For a type-bound procedure of a parametric type, the receiver
declaration must provide the names of local aliases for the type
parameters of the base type.  These names act as type variables within
the procedure.
@end itemize
@noindent
(For the details, please refer to the EBNF grammar at the end of this
section.)

A type declared with a type parameter list like
@samp{T(t1:B1,t2:B2,@dots{},tn:Bn)} is called a @dfn{parametric type}.
The formal type @var{Bi} of a type parameter declaration is called
its type bound.  The type bound must be a record pointer.  A type name
@var{ti} is visible to the end of the type declaration.

For a qualified type expression of the form
@samp{T(A1,A2,@dots{},An)},

@enumerate a
@item
the type @var{T} must be a parametric type,

@item
it must have the same number of type arguments as there are type
parameters, and

@item
each actual type parameter @var{Ai} is either an extension of the
corresponding type bound @var{Bi}, or @var{Ai} is a type variable
whose bound is an extension of @var{Bi}.
@end enumerate

If @var{T} is a parametric type as defined above, then the type
expression @samp{T} (without any type arguments) is equivalent to the
qualified type `@samp{T(B1,B2,@dots{},Bn)}, where each type argument
equals the corresponding type bound.  @var{Bi} and @samp{Ai} can be
forward references to types that are defined later.

A type-bound procedure of a parametric type must define a list of type
names after its receiver type, for example

@example
PROCEDURE (r: P(T1,T2,@dots{})) TBProc(@dots{});
@end example

Each name is a type alias for the corresponding type parameter of the
procedure's @emph{base record} type.  Within a type-bound procedure, a
variable @samp{v: Ti}, with @var{Ti} declared with a type bound
@samp{Ti: Bi}, can for the most part be used like it had been declared
as @samp{v: Bi}.  The exceptions are that it can only be assigned
values of type @var{Ti} (or @code{NIL}), and that @code{NEW} is not
applicable to such a variable.

A type variable cannot be used on the right hand side of a type test
or type guard.

Two qualified types are considered to be the same type, if they have
the same base type and if their corresponding type arguments are of
the same type.

@code{NIL} is assignment compatible with a parametric type if it is
assignment compatible with the type's base type.

@samp{NEW()} is applicable to a variable of parametric type if its
base type is a pointer.

@noindent
Syntax:
@example
TPSection  = ident @{"," ident@} ":" Qualident.
TypePars   = "(" [TPSection @{";" TPSection@}] ")".
TypeDecl   = IdentDef [TypePars] "=" Type ";".

QualType   = Qualident ["(" [QualType @{"," QualType@}] ")"].
Type       = QualType|ArrayType|RecordType|PointerType|ProcType.
RecordType = "RECORD" ["("QualType")"] @dots{} "END".  
FormalPars = ["(" [FPSection @{";" FPSection@}] ")" [":" QualType]].

AliasList = "(" [ident @{"," ident@}] ")".
Receiver = "(" ["VAR"] ident ":" ident  [AliasList] ")".
@end example
         
@emph{Note}: Polymorphic procedures, where free type parameters are
added to a formal parameter list to place an additional restriction on
the acceptable argument lists of calls, are currently not supported.



@node Initialization Functions, Example Module, Parametric Types, Top
@chapter Initialization Functions

The compiler provides a common notation to define an initialization
procedure for an object, to redefine the initialization procedure
within an extended type, and to call this procedure automatically when
creating an object.  For this, a class may provide a type-bound
procedure @code{INIT}, like

@example
PROCEDURE (l: List) INIT*(initialSize: LONGINT);
@end example

Such a procedure has the special property that a call to it always
binds to the procedure bound to the @emph{static} type of the
receiver, @emph{not} the dynamic one.  In this it behaves like a call
to a normal procedure, where the actual code to be evaluated is known
at compile time.

@code{INIT} must not return a result, and it must be exported.  Its
formal parameters do not need to match the parameter list inherited
from the base type, if one exists.  If the base type provides an
@samp{INIT} procedure, but there is no super call like
@samp{l.INIT^(@dots{})}, then the compiler produces a warning.

As a shortcut to create an object is to use @samp{NEW()} as a
function, passing the type of the the new object as its first
argument.  @samp{v := NEW(T,a1,a2,@dots{})} is equivalent to

@example
VAR temp: T;
@dots{}
NEW(temp);
temp.INIT(a1,a2,@dots{});
v := temp;
@end example

The initialization call is omitted if @samp{T} does not define an
@samp{INIT} procedure.

@emph{Note}: The definition of @samp{NEW(v)} when called as a
procedure has not changed.  That is, with this use of @samp{NEW} the
@samp{INIT()} procedure is @emph{not} called implicitly for the new
object.

@emph{Possible changes}: Right now, the type argument of @samp{NEW()}
must be a record pointer.  This might be relaxed to any pointer type
in the future.
