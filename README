See file INSTALL for the list of software requirements and
installation instructions.  See file PROBLEMS if installation turns
out to be difficult.

oo2c translates Oberon-2 source code into a variant of C supported by
the gcc family of compilers.  It uses a variant of SSA for its
intermediate representation, and performs common optimizations like
common subexpression elimination, invariant code motion, constant
propagation, algebraic transformations, and dead code removal.

Operating system, architecture, and gcc combinations that are known to
work:

  Linux 2.4.19/i386/gcc 2.95.4 & 3.2.1
  SunOS 5.6/sparc/gcc 2.95.2 (32 bit)
  SunOS 5.8/sparcv9/gcc 3.2.1 (64 bit)
  Mac OS X/G3/gcc 2.95.2
  Windows 2000/i386/cygwin gcc 2.95.3-5


Typical installation is quite simple:

  tar xfvj oo2c_32-2.0.0.tar.bz2
  cd oo2c_32-2.0.0
  ./configure --prefix ~/mydir
  make install

More information is available in INSTALL.

Building programs is simple as well:

  mkdir /tmp/test
  cd /tmp/test
  mkdir src
  cat >src/T.Mod
    MODULE T;
    IMPORT Out;
    BEGIN
    Out.String("Hello");Out.Ln;
    END T.
  ~/mydir/bin/oo2c --make T
  
And then `bin/T' should say `Hello'.  For more information, please
refer to the man page of oo2c.

I'm mostly interested to hear about installation problems, compiler
bugs (hangs, crashes, wrong error messages or warnings, or missing
error messages), and usability issues.  Please use Sourceforge

  https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=103539&group_id=3539

to report bugs and include the version you are using in the summary
line.  This ensures that bug reports are not lost, and provides a
convenient central location to collect information about bugs.  Bug
reports accompanied by patches fixing the problem at hand are very
welcome.

For miscompiled code, that is, correct input code that produces a
broken binary, please try to create a small program that will
reproduce the error.  Ideally this program is a single module with
just enough lines of code to trigger the bug.  Send me this module,
together with the information on how the bug manifests itself, how to
trigger the bug, and the version of oo2c you are using.

For input modules that hang or crash the compiler, please send me the
module or modules that trigger the problem.  This does not need to be
small.  Don't send me module fragments!
