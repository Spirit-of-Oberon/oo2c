1. Prerequisites


  oo2c 1.5.6
  libadt (from the CVS repository)
  libxml (from the CVS repository)
  GNU make

2. Setting up the Development Environment

Make sure that libxml/src/ and libadt/src/ is in the search path for
*.Mod and *.c (for example, by editing and including .oo2crc_local).
For the language specific tests, the Hostess test files are expected
to reside at `../hostess/hostess/oberon/testcases.xml', as seen from
the ooc2 top-level directory.

Then, do

  ./configure
  . ENV
  make test

If this produces an error, mail me.  (Note: The ". ENV" assumes a
Bourne compabtible shell.  This command sets the environment variables
OOC_DEV_ROOT and MAIN_MAKEFILE.  If you are running a different shell,
you need to do something equivalent.)

--------

An overview over the modules is in src/AllModules.Mod.  Another point
of entry are the test programs.  Currently, the most "evolved" test
programs are src/TestSymTab.Mod (tests/symtab/) and
src/TestInterfaceGen.Mod (tests/interface/).

The general idea of the module structure is: split functionality in
clearly separated subtrees, and have automated tests for all of them.
Here is a list of subsystems:

  configuration (Config:*, OOC:Config:*)
  repository handling (OOC:Repository:*)
  scanner (OOC:Scanner:*)
  abstract syntax tree (OOC:AST:*)
  symbol table (OOC:SymbolTable:*)
  documentation (OOC:Doc:*)
  build engine (OOC:Make:*)

Tests are located in the tests/ subdirectory.  The whole set of tests
is run by doing "make test" in the top-level directory or within
tests/.  To run tests selectively "cd" into the subdirectory and do
"make test".  This requires that the environment variables "OOC" and
"DIFF" are set.  The latter selects the diff command that is run when
comparing files.

For "make doc" to work, set the name for the oocn tool at the
beginning of the Makefile.

"make clean" returns the file tree to a pristine state, removing all
the files that were produced during compilation and testing.
