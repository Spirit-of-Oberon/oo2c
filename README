Requirements:
  oo2c 1.5.3.2
  libadt (from the CVS repository)
  libxml (from the CVS repository)
  GNU make

Make sure that libxml/src/ and libadt/src/ is in the search path for
*.Mod and *.c (e.g., by editing and including .oo2crc_local).  Set the
environment variable OOC to point to your oo2c compiler.  Then, do
"make test" in the root directory.  If this produces an error, mail
me.


An overview over the modules is in src/AllModules.Mod.  Another point
of entry are the test programs.  Currently, the most "evolved" test
programs are src/TestSymTab.Mod (tests/symtab/) and
src/TestInterfaceGen.Mod (tests/interface/).

The general idea of the module structure is: split functionality in
clearly separated subtrees, and have automated tests for all of them.
Here is a list of subsystems:

  configuration (Config:*, OOC:Config:*)
  repository handling (OOC:Repository:*)
  scanner (OOC:Scanner:*)
  abstract syntax tree (OOC:AST:*)
  symbol table (OOC:SymbolTable:*)
  documentation (OOC:Doc:*)
  build engine (OOC:Make:*)

Tests are located in the tests/ subdirectory.  The whole set of tests
is run by doing "make test" in the top-level directory or within
tests/.  To run tests selectively "cd" into the subdirectory and do
"make test".  This requires that the environment variables "OOC" and
"DIFF" are set.  The latter selects the diff command that is run when
comparing files.

For "make doc" to work, set the name for the oocn tool at the
beginning of the Makefile.

"make clean" returns the file tree to a pristine state, removing all
the files that were produced during compilation and testing.
