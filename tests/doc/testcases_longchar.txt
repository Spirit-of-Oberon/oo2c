Character Constants
===================

ACCEPT:

  1) character values in the range 100X to 0FFFFX are LONGCHAR
     values

REJECT:

  1) character constants larger than MAX(LONGCHAR)


String Concatenation
====================

ACCEPT:

  1) a+b and b+a, where `a' is a CHAR constant and `b' is a LONGCHAR
     constant
  2) a+b and b+a, where `a' is a CHAR constant and `b' is a LONGCHAR
     string constant
  3) a+b and b+a, where `a' is a CHAR string constant and `b' is a
     LONGCHAR constant
  4) a+b and b+a, where `a' is a CHAR string constant and `b' is a
     LONGCHAR string constant

REJECT:

  1) a+b where either `a' or `b' is not a character or string constant


Assignment
==========

ACCEPT:

  1) l := c, where `l' is a variable of type LONGCHAR, and `c' a value
     of type CHAR
  2) la := c, where `la' is an ARRAY n OF LONGCHAR, and `c' a CHAR or
     CHAR string constant (and the lengths are ok)
  3) la := c, where `la' is an ARRAY n OF LONGCHAR, and `c' a LONGCHAR
     or LONGCHAR string constant (and the lengths are ok)
  4) CHAR string is passed to an ARRAY OF LONGCHAR
  5) LONGCHAR string is passed to an ARRAY OF LONGCHAR

REJECT:

  1) c := l, where `c' is a variable of type CHAR, and `l' a value
     of type LONGCHAR
  2) ca := l, where `ca' is a variable of type ARRAY n OF CHAR, and
     `l' a value of type LONGCHAR
  3) ca := l, where `ca' is a variable of type ARRAY n OF CHAR, and
     `l' a LONGCHAR string


Comparisons
===========

ACCEPT:

  1) `a op b', where `a' and `b' are character or string constants of
     either type
  2) `a op b', where `a' and `b' are of type LONGCHAR
  3) `a op b', where `a' and `b' are of type ARRAY [n] OF LONGCHAR


REJECT:

  1) `a op b' and `b op a', where `a' is a LONGCHAR or LONGCHAR
     string, and `b' an ARRAY [n] OF CHAR
  2) `a op b' and `b op a', where `a' is an ARRAY [n] OF LONGCHAR, and
     `b' an ARRAY [n] OF CHAR 


Predefined Functions
====================

ACCEPT:

  1) CAP(LONGCHAR)
  2) LONG(CHAR)
  3) LONG(CHAR string)
  4) LONGCHAR(integer)
  5) ORD(LONGCHAR)
  6) SHORT(LONGCHAR)
  7) SHORT(LONGCHAR string)


Predefined Procedures
=====================

ACCEPT:

  1) COPY(LONGCHAR array,LONGCHAR array)
  2) COPY(CHAR array,LONGCHAR array)
  3) COPY(LONGCHAR string,LONGCHAR array)
  4) COPY(CHAR string,LONGCHAR array)
