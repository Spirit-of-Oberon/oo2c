  Whitespace at the beginning of a paragraph is stripped away.

Whitespace within a paragraph is normalized like this: Control
characters (this includes newline) are converted to spaces.    Multiple
spaces are collapsed into a single     space character.  Two
spaces are kept after a dot.
A dot, followed by a newline, is converted to "dot<SPACE><SPACE>".
