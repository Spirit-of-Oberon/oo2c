  <p pad-after='yes' no-indent='no'>Whitespace within a paragraph is normalized like this: Control characters (this includes newline) are converted to spaces.  Multiple spaces are collapsed into a single space character.  Two spaces are kept after a dot.  A dot, followed by a newline, is converted to "dot&lt;SPACE&gt;&lt;SPACE&gt;".</p>
