Please note that it does make a difference in the ASCII version of this
document, if there are paragraph separators in front or behind a list
command.  Here is an @@itemize without surrounding paragraph separators:
@itemize @minus
@item
Item 1.
@item
Item 2.
@end itemize
And this is the end of the list.
