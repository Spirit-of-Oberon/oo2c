Lists are a very convenient feature of any type-setting system.  OOC
supports a subset of the available Texinfo commands, and lists are of
course supported.  The @@itemize command is the most simple list around:

@itemize @bullet
@item
First item.  The list items are indented and marked with a bullet.  In
the ASCII representation the bullet is a simple @samp{*}.  This looks
nicer in the paper version, thanks to TeX.
@item
This second item follows the first without any line break in between.


@item
But the third has three hard line breaks in front of it, and it is also
closed with two hard line breaks.

@item
This is the last item.  Bye.
@end itemize

THE END
