   If instructions work on memory areas, then the areas from which they read
   data, or to which they write data, may intersect.  If this happens, then the
   instructions may no longer be independent of each other.  This module
   provides functions to determine if and how a given variable access aliases
   with that of another instruction.

   Aliasing statements are a function of the memory areas touched by
   instructions.  If the instructions work on distinct memory locations, then
   they do not alias.  On the other hand, if they access even a single common
   byte, or if there is a chance that this may happen, then they do alias.

   Read and write access to memory is distinguished.  For example, if two
   reading instructions alias, they can still be scheduled in either order.
   For two aliasing write instructions, order is significant and must not be
   changed.

   When comparing the set of memory locations accessed by two instructions that
   read or write variables, different situations can arise:

   @table @asis
   @item Empty Intersection
   In this case, both instructions are independent of each other, because they
   access distinct subsets of the program's state.

   @item Equal Sets
   The instructions work on the same set of data.  This allows various
   improvements, for example eliminating the second read instruction because it
   delivers the same result as the first.

   @item Non-empty Intersection
   If the sets of memory locations are not equal, but still share common
   locations, then the instructions are not independent.  Interpretation of
   such a situation depends on the context.

   @item Indefinite Intersection
   Most of the time, static program analysis cannot determine the intersection
   set during compile time.  For one and the same instruction, the aliasing
   status may differ with each evaluation during run-time.  In this case, no
   program transformation can be applied that depends on knowledge about its
   aliasing status.
   @end table

   The aliasing relationship between two instructions is commutative for empty
   intersections and for equal sets of memory locations, but not for indefinite
   aliasing or non-empty intersections.  *)
