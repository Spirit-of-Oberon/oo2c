(** This is the most simple builder for a scanner: it takes the string
representation of the symbols, and writes it unchanged to the
designated output channel.  The output produced this way matches the
input data character to character, even if the scanner reports illegal
or malformed symbols.  Note that the scanner also passes whitespace to
the builder.  *)
